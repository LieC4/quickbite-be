- Seed data for Resstaurant, Dish and Category

- Remove dish from cart

- Set quantity of CartDish from cart

!!!!!!!!!! : The price for delivery should be calculated only once (for each restaurant from which we order) !!!!!!!!!!!

PAIN POINT : 
- When ordering, we should calculate the delivery price not for every dish, -_-_-but for every restaurant-_-_-

Fix adding dish to cart and applying / (or not) delivery cost.
When deleting, must calculate back the total price without the deleted items

=== === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === === 

var cartDishFromDb = cart.CartDishes.SingleOrDefault(cartDish => cartDish.DishId == request.DishId); <==> can be turned into one method that 
=> public Task<CartDish> GetCartDishForUser(int userId, int dishId){...} 


- When the user (in the cart) changes the quantity of CartDish to 0 and presses update, it gets deleted.

- verifications for user input. Example: request.Quantity should always be greater or equal than 0.

- CartDish should have a property: double cartDishPrice. would make the job easier and maybe cleaner.
